# TileVania
This is the 4th game that i made.  
It is a fun platformer game with tilemap system.  
There are many unity functionalities used while making this game such as:  
Tilemap ruler, singleton patern, coroutines, input system, state driven cameras, animator controller, level creation.  
We are trying to reach the exit while avoiding hazards and enemies.  
We can shoot the enemies, clim ladders and use mushrooms to bounce.
